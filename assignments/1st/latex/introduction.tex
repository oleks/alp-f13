This report is written in Literate Haskell, documenting a Haskell
implementation of the intermediate language, IL, defined in \cite[Section 3.2
(p.  36)]{torben}. The grammar is first tranformed into a parsing expression
grammar, making it suitable for parsing using one of the many parser generators
in the standard Haskell library. Once we can parse the language, we define a
procedure for liveness analysis as described in \cite[Section 3.4
(p.38)]{torben}.
