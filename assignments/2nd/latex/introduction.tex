This report is written in Literate Haskell, documenting a Haskell
implementation of an interpreter for a subset of Prolog, referred to as Pl. The
Pure Prolog part is complete, but certain extensions are unfortunately lacking.
In particular, cuts are only partially implemented, and negation as failure
\emph{is absent}. Negation as failure is however discussed throughout the
report, arguing for how it could be implemented. \emph{Note:} due to the
incomplete implementation, the code compiles with warnings.

We first describe the grammar used in \referToSection{grammar}. In
\referToSection{parser} we describe a parser for parsing modules and queries.
In \referToSection{main} we describe the main program and how to interact with
the interpreter. In \referToSection{testing} we discuss the tests that were
conducted. The busy reader can safely skip \referToSection{parser}.
