\section{Testing}\label{section:testing}

Uploaded with the code is a \texttt{Makefile}, implying that you should be able
to compile the code using \texttt{make}, and obtain an executable
\texttt{./Pl}. You can then run the interpreter by specifying a path to a Pl
module as a command line argument, e.g. \texttt{./Pl append.pl}.

Uploaded with the code is a series of \texttt{.pl} files.

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{simple.pl} a very simplistic module for testing backtracking, and
simple goal resolution.

\item \texttt{append.pl} corresponds to the module in the assignment text; it
was tested with various queries, including \texttt{append(As, Bs,
cons(1,cons(2,cons(3,nil))))}. 

\item \texttt{listappend.pl} corresponds to \texttt{append.pl}, but with list
notation; it was tested with various queries, including \texttt{append(As, Bs,
[1,2,3])}.

\end{itemize}

Below is a sample \texttt{listappend.pl}:

\begin{verbatim}
